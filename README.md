# GraphicsPlayground :space_invader:
This is a hobby project for 2D and 3D graphics. Current implementation is closely tied to [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/).
The engine is platform independent. I/O is partially implemented for Windows ([src](code/Editor/win32_Editor.cpp)) but not for Linux.

## Build
The project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/ "CMake's homepage") as build tool. Once installed you can you can follow the [guide](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/) or run `cmake --help` to get started.
